============= GIT WORKFLOW STEPS =======================================
Basically we need to follow below GIT workflow whenever you are working with GIT repo

Workflow without Branching 
-------------------------------
Step 1: Git clone <URL for the repo>
Do your changes in the cloned code, add new files etc 

Step 2: Git status   (here you may see Untracked changes)

Step 3: Git add -A (to all all new things like changes to the file as well as new files)

Step 4: Git status (now you will notice your new files are added in changes to be committed)

Step 5: Git commit -m “message like FINTAX-12345” (commit is simply to lock your code changes and it’s not actually committed/synced to the git main repo)

Step 6: Git push   (this is the final command which will push your changes to the git repo)

Note: Keep on doing git commit to lock your latest changes incrementally , rather than doing it all at once after you are done with the changes.
